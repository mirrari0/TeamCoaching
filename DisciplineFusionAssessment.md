Discipline Fusion Assessment
===

Here are some tests that one can run in order to determine whether a multidisciplinary team is operating is a "fused" manner.

But first! Lets get some terms down.

Terms
---

Team - A group of individual people working together to achieve an outcome.

Project - A set of work that intends to achieve an outcome. A team works on a project.

Product - A valuable artifact, created or maintained by a team. A project may create a product, update a product, or 
create more than one product.    

Discipline - A distinct branch of knowledge used to perform work on a team.

Fusion - The state in which a team is integrating multiple disciplines successfully.

Stories - A discreet slice of work that can be performed. Stories are preferably written from a user's perspective.

Tests

#### Access Time
Do all the disciplines integrated on the team have instant access to each other?

#### Regular Interdisciplinary Contact
Do individuals working within a discipline have meaningful (project-related) encounters with individuals working in 
other disciplines at least once throughout the day?

#### Shared Conceptual Model
Do all the disciplines share the business object model and use it to communicate concepts? When the model needs to be 
updated, do they solicit feedback from the perspective of the other disciplines?

#### Common Project Story
Can every member of the team tell the story of what the project is, and why we're doing it?

#### Implementation Autonomy
Does the team have sufficient authority to make core implementation decisions? Is there a discipline or responsibility
 that's been outsourced that regularly causes work to be stopped?

#### Line of Sight
Do all team members have clear visibility as to what the rest of the team is currently working on, including in other 
disciplines?

#### Discipline Antifragility
Can every individual member of the team leave for weeks without causing a hard block?

#### Personal Collaboration Discretion
Are team members ever penalized for stopping their own story in order to help other team members (regardless of 
core discipline)?

#### Comprehensible Work Plan
Do the stories on the project deliver strategic, experimental, or tangible value? Do they communicate to 
stakeholders what they're intended to achieve?

#### Discipline Depth
Are all of the disciplines needed for the project represented with enough depth for the project to be successful?
