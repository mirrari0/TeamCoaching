Discipline Fusion Assessment
===

Here are some tests that one can run in order to determine whether a multidisciplinary team is operating is a "fused" manner.

But first! Lets get some terms down.

Terms
---

Team - A group of individual people working together to achieve an outcome.

Project - A set of work that intends to achieve an outcome. A team works on a project.

Product - A valuable artifact, created or maintained by a team. A project may create a product, update a product, or 
create more than one product.    

Discipline - A distinct branch of knowledge used to perform work on a team.

Fusion - The state in which a team is integrating multiple disciplines successfully.

Stories - A discreet slice of work that can be performed. Stories are preferably written from a user's perspective.

Tests
---

#### Access Time
Do all the disciplines integrated on the team have instant access to each other?

#### Regular Interdisciplinary Contact
Do individuals working within a discipline have meaningful (project-related) encounters with individuals working in 
other disciplines at least once throughout the day?

#### Shared Conceptual Model
Do all the disciplines share the business object model and use it to communicate concepts? When the model needs to be 
updated, do they solicit feedback from the perspective of the other disciplines?

#### Common Project Story
Can every member of the team tell the story of what the project is, and why we're doing it?

#### Implementation Autonomy
Does the team have sufficient authority to make core implementation decisions? Is there a discipline or responsibility
 that's been outsourced that regularly causes work to be stopped?

#### Line of Sight
Do all team members have clear visibility as to what the rest of the team is currently working on, including in other 
disciplines?

#### Discipline Antifragility
Can every individual member of the team leave for weeks without causing a hard block?

#### Personal Collaboration Discretion
Are team members ever penalized for stopping their own story in order to help other team members (regardless of 
core discipline)?

#### Comprehensible Work Plan
Do the stories on the project deliver strategic, experimental, or tangible value? Do they communicate to 
stakeholders what they're intended to achieve?

#### Discipline Depth
Are all of the disciplines needed for the project represented with enough depth for the project to be successful?

After a team has asked and answered all of the questions posed by the tests above, they will probably be looking for 
ways to improve. This section will consider each of the tests, and make suggestions about how a team can get improve.

### Improving Access Time

Having fast access to team members is a major factor in team performance and success - the sooner misconceptions can be corrected, debates can be aired, and work converged, the easier it is to give a project a unified, coherent voice. The principle of continuous integration applies to concepts, design, and language just as much as it applied to technical components.

Given this, a common solution for access problems is to co-locate the entire team, and have a norm of working from the co-located space a super-majority of the time. By at least getting people into the same space, you have removed the first barrier of inaccessibility - "out of sight, out of mind".

This isn't a cure-all solution. Even in open offices, teams can develop cultures of "invisible walls", and these can take a number of forms. Some quick examples of invisible walls:
 - team members wear headphones for long stretches of time
 - team members work too far from each other for a quick 'across the room' question
 - team members respond negatively to requests for a pop-up collaboration session
 
 The underlying goal here is that we want teams that have a culture where:
 - it is always ok to ask for help or feedback
 - it is always ok to respond with "I can't immediately but is it ok I reach out to you in a few minutes", or "I think this other team member might be better suited for your question, lets loop them in"
 - it is not ok to discourage team members from reaching out, even if becomes a point of stress
 - it is not ok to ask for assistance in a rude or entitled way, or in any way insensitive to the person who
 the request is targeted at
 
 These suggestions are built from this premise: investing in the team *is* investing in the project's success. We will trade personal performance in the moment for overall team performance in the longer term.
 
 Physical co-location isn't the only way for teams to succeed at "Improving Access Time". Some teams prefer a digital "co-location" approach. In order to make this work, this also requires very, very strong norms. Where a physically co-located team may define "core hours" that people will work on site, a digital "co-located" team may define "core channels" through which a super-majory of team communications must flow. That is to say, rather than have a room with a shared audio space where people can overhear each other, the team may have a chat channel where all project discussions occur, in a public space, so that there are opportunities for incidental overhearing. It is *very important* to minimize the number of channels the team operates through, because additional channels can easily create the same "invisible wall" problems that physical co-location has. And of course, nurturing the culture of being "available and interruptable" is just as important on a digitally co-located team as it is on any team.
 
 ### Improving Regular Interdisciplinary Contact
 
 Its not uncommon for team members working within specific disciplines to begin to cluster together, both physically and socially. There are a number of natural causes for this behavior, and it shouldn't be considered negative unto itself - those discipline-specific relationships are the most important on a team, because they help ensure that the discipline as a whole shares a common vision.
 
 That said, when these clusters "harden", the team as a whole becomes less unified, and rather than sharing a common language and customs, the clusters develop their own separately.
 
 The goal of improving regular interdisciplinary contact is to create space where team members from each discipline can interact regularly and predictably, giving them opportunities to reinforce shared language, customs, and goals. This also helps share knowledge of the strengths of the team.
 
 Some tools that have been employed to improve and encourage contact are:
    
##### Scheduled Stand up meetings
A stand up meeting is a short meeting (5-10 minutes for typical size teams, max 15 for large teams) to temperature-check what's going on. A stand up meeting should include at-least every member of the team, and should have some unscheduled time available afterward for follow-up conversations. Stand up meetings where there are non-participants may not be delivering the intended value - if someone attends a stand up, they should participate, whether or not their current work is considered 'relevant' to the group. This is because the essence of a stand up meeting is discovering the *unexpectedly relevant*, and thus habits of self censorship are to be avoided. By the same token though, this is why deep dives and explorations are inappropriate for stand up and should be expressed in other meetings / rituals.
##### Story Acceptance Contact
Another way to reinforce meaningful interdisciplinary contact is to make part of the team agreement that "representatives of the other discipline(s)" are required to declare a story "complete". In this way, all work that is completed has to be described and understood by at least one other discipline, thus reinforcing a common understanding. Various flavors of this can be used depending on the shape of the project.
##### Periodic Role Swap
Another technique that can be used is to periodically move someone who works in one discipline to a different discipline. While they will have to be a junior member for the duration of the swap, this will give them the beginning of an insider understanding of what the discipline does, and the tools they use to perform the work. Of course, this should only be done to the degree it can be without adversely affecting the performance of the team.
##### Strategic Collaboration
Oftentimes, core design decisions for the product will need input from all the relevant disciplines. To ensure that all points of view are represented, create a planning cadence such that representatives of each discipline can assist in creating the story plan. Sometimes this kind of work is singular enough that it is appropriately written as a story to be executed by multiple disciplines together-as-one. It is very easy to accidentally 'freeze' a discipline out by assuming their motives, so addressing this problem is important.

### Improving Shared Conceptual Model
Operating as a unified team hinges on creating and nurturing a common project-related language. That is to say, every project has a series of concepts and nouns that describe the landscape of the project. Frequently, these will relate to describing a process that the project is intended to improve in some way. This set of terms and relationships is a conceptual object model, also commonly known as a business object model. Ultimately, the object model must also be easily comprehensible to the users of the product, because it will be come the language of the product. Therefore, it is important for it to be well curated.
Properly understood, this model is and must be a shared artifact that all disciplines use in order to execute work - because the model is fundamentally abstract (it should be easily regenerated with a white board and a marker), versions of it will appear in all artifacts related to the project. For example, the model will be expressed in:
- Value Stories (at the absolute highest level)
- User Stories
- Product mock-ups
- User interviews
- Software user interfaces
- Hardware user interfaces
- Source code
- And even more.
 
 Its fairly easy for disciplines to fall out of sync on their understanding of the the object model. For example, the design group's understanding of the users can easily run far ahead of the software development group. Or, a converse example, the software development group may have to modify the model because some of the relationships were too loosely defined, and they failed to test those changes back against the design groups understanding. Given enough time and weak communication, small differences in the model's understanding can lead to inconsistencies in the product that have a high user impact. They can also sour a collaborate relationship between disciplines into a negative adversarial one.
 
 So what to do? How does a team get better at this? A few suggestions follow.
